# MyReads Project

This is a Project from the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. It was bootstraped with npm install creat-react-app.
My Reads is a small single page application to manage your current and future readings. You can search new books and add them to your virtual bookshelf. The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

To use this Project use:
-> git clone https://github.com/l3and3rH/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git

In the Terminal go to the main directory and use "npm install" & "npm start"
If there are any problems occuring, check your node version and use create react app to install all dependencies first.
